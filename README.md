# procursus-action

Bootstraps the Procursus toolchain onto a macOS runner. 

## Wait, what's Theos?

[Procursus](https://github.com/ProcursusTeam/Procursus) is a build-system that provides a large set of consistently up-to-date *nix tools cross compiled to work on Darwin based platforms.

## Usage

Only macOS runners, since Procursus itself only compiles for Darwin-based platforms

```bash
- uses: beerpiss/procursus-action@v1

# That's it, there's no other arguments.

```
